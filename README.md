# Text-to-CSV-Convertor

This Python script allows you to combine multiple text files into a single Excel workbook, with each text file represented as a separate sheet. It's a handy tool for organizing and summarizing text-based data into a more structured format.

**Usage**
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python Downloads.

Save the script in a .py file (e.g., combine_to_excel.py).

Replace path_to_input_folder with the actual path to the folder containing your text files, and "output_excel_file.xlsx" with the desired name for the output Excel file.

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the script's directory, and run the script using the command:
python combine_to_excel.py

The script will combine text files from the input folder, creating separate sheets for each file in the output Excel workbook.

Find the output Excel file in the same directory as the script.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Pandas library (pip install pandas)
